# Source code of the CSGO neural network

All the code is provided "as is."  
Detectors are divided into classes and subclasses.  
The dataset is separate and available for download to Boosty subscribers: https://boosty.to/howdyho

Other than that:
For now, you'll have to figure it out on your own — there’s no documentation yet.

The archive contains various scripts for auto-aiming and detecting.

It also includes different generations of models for the Yolov7 and Yolov8 neural networks (including those for semi-automatic generation).
